If racism was created by society to favor people who are seen as white, why is it not defined as such? Would the definition not be “The favoring of white people against all other races”? This is how I see it based on how we are taught in this curriculum. The Pre-AP English way of describing racism, and prejudice does conflict with my point of view on racism, and prejudice, so in the following paragraphs I will critically analyze the two.">

<p>In Pre-AP English 10 this year, I learned about reading, and writing; the basics of any language arts class in history. However for the majority of the class, I learned about the meanings and themes behind other works. One theme that popped up more frequently than others was racism - societal trends that favor one race over another, and “whiteness” - one being privileged for being born white. I agree with parts of both of these statements, however, racism is more fluid than just purely being white people looking down from their pedestal on to people of other races, It is based on the circumstance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Society - The totality of social relationships among humans.</p>
<footer><strong>The Free Dictionary</strong><cite><a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/society" target="_blank" rel="external">Definition of Society</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
<p>If racism was created by society to favor people who are seen as white, why is it not defined as such? Would the definition not be “The favoring of white people against all other races”? This is how I see it based on how we are taught in this curriculum. The Pre-AP English way of describing racism, and prejudice does conflict with my point of view on racism, and prejudice, so in the following paragraphs I will critically analyze the two.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Now backing up, to learn about human instincts. When you meet a person you do not know, you judge them (regardless of if you want to or not). You judge them based on how they talk, how they walk, how they stand, what they are saying, and many more subtle social cues. Based on these judgments, you form a stereotype personalized just for their characteristics. These stereotypes, overtime, get reused by your brain for people who share similar characteristics to save time in judging someone. This is important because if someone is truly trying to kill you, you do not judge them, and you greet them like your friend; you are most likely dead. Stereotypes have earned a bad reputation over time, because of their ability to so quickly to become a prejudice. Prejudice is unproven evidence, and opinionated events that back an irrational view toward a person, or a group of people. Stereotypes are survival instincts formulated to protect us from death. Stereotypes by themselves are fine, because they protect us, however when they turn into prejudices, they become harmful.</p>
<p>_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road" target="_blank" rel="external">The Road</a>_ by Cormac McCarthy is an excellent example of how stereotypes can be an essential asset to survival. In the book, Papa and the Boy come upon the traveler; on first meeting him, Papa states warily “If this is an ambush, he [traveler] goes first.” (McCarthy, 162) This shows that the stereotype that everyone that they come upon should not be trusted is wrong, however does not turn into a prejudice once Papa meets the man.</p>
<p>If prejudice is formed by one, it is just that; one person judging someone too severely based on an unproven, irrational prejudice. However, if a majority group of people holds prejudice towards another minority group, it becomes racism.</p>
<p>Instead of educating on the idea of “whiteness”, which is propagated psychologically through people telling other people that “white people are better” (which is completely wrong), education should be focused more on correcting the issue. To carry this out, yes, people need to be educated that racism is apart of their lives, however, like the pollution, can be prevented enough to have an impact on society.</p>
<p>I believe that the texts studied throughout the year were exceedingly one sided in their view on race. I do think that the view of “whiteness” is accurate in these contexts, however this is not the whole picture. An examples of racism against white people can be found in South Africa, where Apartheid made many South Africans resent the white minority. When Apartheid broke down, white citizens lose a large amount of power, and were resented by the black majority. This small fact of the majority group holding prejudice against a minority group also exposes a flaw in the one sided argument that white people have the most power universally.</p>
<p>This idea is conveyed through the book _<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night_Lights%3A_A_Town%2C_a_Team%2C_and_a_Dream" target="_blank" rel="external">Friday Night Lights</a>_ by H.G. Bissinger (which I do not own, so cannot directly quote), when conservative white citizens from rural Odessa, TX, describe liberals as the scum of the earth, and how they are all so wrong about everything they say. This is yet another example of how people look favorably on people who have similar views and characteristics as themselves, but look down on those who are different.</p>
<p>When no one group is a majority, the power is distributed more or less evenly. This can be seen in the documetary <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1559549/" target="_blank" rel="external">Restrepo</a></em>, which is about the U.S. Army in the Korangal Valley of northeast Afghanistan, because all of the soliders were trained in the same way, their views, are similar, therefore accept people around them in the army.</p>
<p>The reason I believe (based on facts, and examples from a variety of events and sources) that why white people seem to be favored here in my part of the United States, is that naturally humans like to be around people who are just like themselves (<a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/ps/genes_like.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">Relevant</a>), their culture, their race, gender, political views, etc. This means that if there is a majority of white people in a room, naturally, the white people will have the most influence, and power, unless a minority shares similarities with more in the room.</p>
