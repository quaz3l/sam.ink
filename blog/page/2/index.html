    <p>I am starting on a new project called <a href="http://ficte.com">Ficte</a> which will be a place to read and write short stories, poems, and other forms of creative writing. <em>Plug: If you feel you would like to try out the service when it is finished, <a href="http://ficte.com">sign up to get notified here</a>.</em></p>
<p>In order to promote <a href="http://ficte.com">Ficte</a>, I needed a splash page with a feature list, and a form to receive emails of people who are interested. I did not really want to go write a large back-end for this, so I went to <a href="http://eepurl.com/CEiWX">MailChimp</a> (Disclaimer: Referral), which, to my surprise, was a free service for people who have a small amount of subscribers. I jumped on this, and went through the steps to setup a list. When I got to connecting my list with my splash page, I got a great <em>(sarcasm)</em> copy-and-paste form which when submitted, directed to MailChimp to confirm the subscription. This is something I did not like, so I caved on my idea of no back-end, and wrote a simple <abbr title="Node.js Framework">Express</abbr> app (which I will use for the rest of Ficte); This is how I did it.<br>

    <p><em>Disclaimer: This work was written based on criteria put forth in the “Race Reflection” rubric, which calls for opinionated thoughts. The opinions conveyed through this work are not to directly attack, or otherwise slander the teachers, administration, or any other persons associated with the creation or execution of the “Pre-AP English 10” curriculum (“The Authors”). This work was written to act as a critique of the curriculum, and was written with the intent to inform The Authors of an alternative perspective on “Pre-AP English 10”.</em></p>
<p>In Pre-AP English 10 this year, I learned about reading, and writing; the basics of any language arts class in history. However for the majority of the class, I learned about the meanings and themes behind other works. One theme that popped up more frequently than others was racism - societal trends that favor one race over another, and “whiteness” - one being privileged for being born white. I agree with parts of both of these statements, however, racism is more fluid than just purely being white people looking down from their pedestal on to people of other races, It is based on the circumstance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Society - The totality of social relationships among humans.</p>
<footer><strong>The Free Dictionary</strong><cite><a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/society">Definition of Society</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
<p>If racism was created by society to favor people who are seen as white, why is it not defined as such? Would the definition not be “The favoring of white people against all other races”? This is how I see it based on how we are taught in this curriculum. The Pre-AP English way of describing racism, and prejudice does conflict with my point of view on racism, and prejudice, so in the following paragraphs I will critically analyze the two.<br>

    <p>Throughout my life, I have thought a lot about the ultimate question “What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?”, or just “What is the meaning of life?” In my time alive, I have changed my point of view many times. From being a religious person, and praying often, to being a complete atheist, and nihilist, to coming up with my own perspective based on my past experiences, and ideas. Here is my perspective over time.<br>

    <p>I’ve been playing on computers since I was about 3, and played the stupid games kids play, like Reader Rabbit, Freddy Fish or whatever, and other things back when I still heard the word “CD-ROM”. That was fun and all, I was a kid, and I learned how to use a computer from those games. I also learned that to connect to the internet, the computer needed to call another computer on the phone, have a nice conversation about what they were doing thing weekend, how are the kids, then finally remember what they were making the call for, and connect me to the web.<br>

    <p><a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">LibGDX</a> is an amazing tool to develop mobile applications cross-platform. I have been developing a mobile game for Android, and iOS, and it has worked very well so far despite some bumps. However there was one issue I had that I really did struggle with; that is text, and bitmap fonts.</p>
<p>In Objective-C it is fairly simple to write text on the screen, we call the system font, or a font from file, the text we would like to write, and the coordinate on screen. This is very straight forward unlike much of Objective-C. In Java, and with LibGDX, it is not as easy. To do this we need to create a bitmap font, which is not that easy in itself, then define a font from a picture, and a description file. Once we have that, we can define a font in Java:<br><figure class="highlight java"><figcaption><span>Defining a Bitmap Font in LibGDX</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// ...</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> SpriteBatch batch;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> BitmapFont font;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// ...</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="annotation">@Override</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">create</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">	batch = <span class="keyword">new</span> SpriteBatch();</span><br><span class="line">	font = <span class="keyword">new</span> BitmapFont(Gdx.files.internal(<span class="string">"data/schooler.fnt"</span>),Gdx.files.internal(<span class="string">"data/schooler.png"</span>),<span class="keyword">false</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// ...</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><br>We also need to define a sprite batch which helps manage drawing efficiently. To draw text in the render method we need to start the sprite batch, then use the font to draw the text. This is where it gets more complex,
