    <p>“Learn from your mistakes” is a common saying heard throughout life. You probably first heard it from a parent, but chances are you also hear it from friends, coworkers, or teachers at least once a month. It is a great idea, make something that was a bad choice worthwhile, as if you are walking at night, and that mistake lights a part of the path, no matter how faint the light, it helps you stay on course.</p>
<p>However mistakes are not the only place one can learn from. It surprises me that mistakes are so often seen by society as the best way to learn, while successes do not seem to be highlighted as much. Success is the ultimate goal of any project, product, objective, or idea. Although “success” my be abstract, you know when you achieve it, and know how to succeed next time.</p>
<p>Being able to learn to not do something is great, but to learn how something is done is way better, and more efficient. For example when I try to memorize my name, I know the first letter is S, but if I only knew what the first letter was not, I would have to memorize a whole lot more. This idea of learning from success, not just from failure is not new, but it should be seen more equal, to learning from mistakes.</p>

    <p>I am starting on a new project called <a href="http://ficte.com">Ficte</a> which will be a place to read and write short stories, poems, and other forms of creative writing. <em>Plug: If you feel you would like to try out the service when it is finished, <a href="http://ficte.com">sign up to get notified here</a>.</em></p>
<p>In order to promote <a href="http://ficte.com">Ficte</a>, I needed a splash page with a feature list, and a form to receive emails of people who are interested. I did not really want to go write a large back-end for this, so I went to <a href="http://eepurl.com/CEiWX">MailChimp</a> (Disclaimer: Referral), which, to my surprise, was a free service for people who have a small amount of subscribers. I jumped on this, and went through the steps to setup a list. When I got to connecting my list with my splash page, I got a great <em>(sarcasm)</em> copy-and-paste form which when submitted, directed to MailChimp to confirm the subscription. This is something I did not like, so I caved on my idea of no back-end, and wrote a simple <abbr title="Node.js Framework">Express</abbr> app (which I will use for the rest of Ficte); This is how I did it.<br>

    <p><em>Disclaimer: This work was written based on criteria put forth in the “Race Reflection” rubric, which calls for opinionated thoughts. The opinions conveyed through this work are not to directly attack, or otherwise slander the teachers, administration, or any other persons associated with the creation or execution of the “Pre-AP English 10” curriculum (“The Authors”). This work was written to act as a critique of the curriculum, and was written with the intent to inform The Authors of an alternative perspective on “Pre-AP English 10”.</em></p>
<p>In Pre-AP English 10 this year, I learned about reading, and writing; the basics of any language arts class in history. However for the majority of the class, I learned about the meanings and themes behind other works. One theme that popped up more frequently than others was racism - societal trends that favor one race over another, and “whiteness” - one being privileged for being born white. I agree with parts of both of these statements, however, racism is more fluid than just purely being white people looking down from their pedestal on to people of other races, It is based on the circumstance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Society - The totality of social relationships among humans.</p>
<footer><strong>The Free Dictionary</strong><cite><a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/society">Definition of Society</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
<p>If racism was created by society to favor people who are seen as white, why is it not defined as such? Would the definition not be “The favoring of white people against all other races”? This is how I see it based on how we are taught in this curriculum. The Pre-AP English way of describing racism, and prejudice does conflict with my point of view on racism, and prejudice, so in the following paragraphs I will critically analyze the two.<br>

<div class="article-body ">
  
    <p>Throughout my life, I have thought a lot about the ultimate question “What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?”, or just “What is the meaning of life?” In my time alive, I have changed my point of view many times. From being a religious person, and praying often, to being a complete atheist, and nihilist, to coming up with my own perspective based on my past experiences, and ideas. Here is my perspective over time.<br>

    <p>I’ve been playing on computers since I was about 3, and played the stupid games kids play, like Reader Rabbit, Freddy Fish or whatever, and other things back when I still heard the word “CD-ROM”. That was fun and all, I was a kid, and I learned how to use a computer from those games. I also learned that to connect to the internet, the computer needed to call another computer on the phone, have a nice conversation about what they were doing thing weekend, how are the kids, then finally remember what they were making the call for, and connect me to the web.<br>
