    <p>I’ve been playing on computers since I was about 3, and played the stupid games kids play, like Reader Rabbit, Freddy Fish or whatever, and other things back when I still heard the word “CD-ROM”. That was fun and all, I was a kid, and I learned how to use a computer from those games. I also learned that to connect to the internet, the computer needed to call another computer on the phone, have a nice conversation about what they were doing thing weekend, how are the kids, then finally remember what they were making the call for, and connect me to the web.<br><a id="more"></a><br>When I was 8, I found Python, but not really. I found a tutorial online which showed me how to use Panda 3D to create a panda walking through a field, and copy and pasted ALL OF THE CODE, not even reading it, into my text editor, saving it, and running it to do exactly what the tutorial said. I showed it to my parents like it was some horrible paint splatter I made in kindergarten, yet saw it as an amazing feat of creativity; they looked at me and said “oh yes Sam, nice job…”, in that monotone voice they use when they are not impressed, but want me to think they were. I went back to playing Reader Rabbit.</p>
<p>When I was 10, I had one friend. His name was Danny, and he is the reason I am even writing this post on this journal no one reads, because he presented to me the now retired “&lt;center&gt;” tag. He showed me how to be a puppeteer of my very own puppet show, and it opened the gates to my creativity and self expression.</p>
<p>I loved games, so I wanted to create a flash game website (unique right?). I succeeded in stealing a few .SWF files for my website, and secured a .CO.CC domain. I also, of course, had no money since I was 10, so I found a free webhost, 000webhost.com I think it was. Writing this, I am actually surprised I managed to get that far, I even was able to follow the steps to setup DNS settings.</p>
<p>I remember writing the site, I had three pages, which I copied the idea from every other website; I had a “Home” page, a “Games” page (yes one page for all the swf files), and an “About” page - which nothing ever resided on. I didn’t know that index.html was the default page at first, so I had the home page at home.html, until I figured that out from other websites.</p>
<p>When I was 11, I discovered CSS, and as you can imagine, my website got a whole lot better. It got a BACKGROUND IMAGE! I also discovered interactivity first through javascript events inline with the HTML, like “onclick”, and “onmouseover”, this helped me make my buttons change from atrocious yellow to orange gradients, and blue Comic-Sans text, to the inverse to show that a mouse was on a button. Oh, did I mention all the images were made in MSPaint, and saved as bitmaps.</p>
<p>When I was 12, I figured out that the server actually did stuff when I looked at the source of another, much better gaming website to figure out how to create a login system, when I saw that no password stuff was in the source, I knew there was something else. This is when my use of PHP started. At first it was very primitive, and function based, no object-oriented programming in sight. I begged my mom to let me purchase a .com domain, but being 12, I was politely declined, so I went back to co.cc, and registered GameBrave.co.cc, which became a full fledged gaming website, which has the code almost unchanged since then at <a href="http://gamebrave.com" target="_blank" rel="external">gamebrave.com</a>.</p>
<p>GameBrave became my life. I kept updating, and improving the website. You can see the later versions (without style) on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100301000000*/http://gamebrave.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Wayback Machine</a>. I put all the data in a MySQL database, and I remember when I first set it up, and put in my credentials, I was worried people would be able to see them in plain text on the web like you would HTML.</p>
<p>I also started making flash games myself. I downloaded Flash Professional, the trial miraculously froze, and I developed 4 horrible games. 2 mouse maze games, a tower defense game, and a physics based “get to the exit” game (if you’re from Adobe, don’t sue my 12 year old self).</p>
<p><em>update (September 2014): I wrote this while I was mad at the internet for being mean to me. Everything below is not coherent.</em></p>
<p>That was my start, 6 years of mucking around with web stuff, then got into Java later with Minecraft, and developed qQuests, the most popular questing plugin at a time, but according to #coding on IRC, and many other places, making Minecraft plugins is not really coding, despite me having implemented best coding practice, and having my plugin include over 30 major original classes created by me, (EDIT: I picked the number of classes, because I thought it showed how much effort went into my project, however it is not the best metric).</p>
<p>I am writing this because I did it differently. I learned by copy and pasting novels of code, and did not read a single book, or take a single class. I love code, and would love to continue, but when I try to interact with anyone else in programming, I always get shutdown, voted down, reported, kicked, deleted, I even was made fun of by a guy who makes a living writing Java to cure cancer in New Zealand.</p>
<p>I hate how cheesy the word “Cyberbullying” is, but that is what it is. I try to reach out to other programmers for advice (yes advice, not code to copy and paste), yet every time, I get shut down.</p>
<p>I don’t like it.</p>
<p>So can the internet stop for a second, and think:</p>
<p>Maybe be nice for a change?</p>
