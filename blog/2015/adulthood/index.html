    <p>“Hello my name is Sam Schooler, and I don’t know how old I am,” Sam admitted as he walked into <strong>Children’s Anonymous</strong>, a group which helps support adults who have not yet crossed the barrier from childhood to adulthood.</p>
<p>“I started going to this group a while back.” Sam told our reporter, “What I didn’t realize is that the group saw being a child as a flaw. I don’t see being a child as a flaw, I see it as an opportunity. An opportunity for me to do things adults my age would never think of doing.”</p>
<p>Sam went to the group only 3 or 4 times before he had enough, and “just kinda stopped going, and started watching clouds and stuff.” We were not satisfied. In this unique situation, we wanted to know more. We asked him about his experience once he accepted the fact he will be a child for the foreseeable future. “I think I will try to get more people to be children. That seems fun. A sort of group that supports older children.”<br><a id="more"></a><br>“What makes me different from adults my age is that I know there is more to life than just getting a job, making money, having a family, retiring, and dying. I intend to enjoy life, so instead of trying to go find money, power or glory; I try and find the fun in the world. Keep in mind, this does not mean I’m just going to play in the park everyday. I am now a child with more privileges. I can travel, possibly learn about the migration habits of salmon, go biking long distances, or go swimming at night.”</p>
<p>This is a profound difference from what normal lives are supposed to be. We wanted to figure out how he plans to support this lifestyle without the support of his parents.</p>
<p>“Simple. Get a job. It does not seem like something a child would do. But, just like when I lived with my parents, I needed to do chores before I could go outside to play. Same concept with a job; I need to work before I can play. I’ll also let you in on a little secret,” Sam leaned in quietly, looking around before whispering, “Your job and school don’t need to be boring…just learn and work with things you like!”</p>
<p>We were truly excited about this new way to think about life. We pushed on. Learning how he could possibly plan to do these things in a world of businessmen, and scams. He explain that: “Learn how to be the red marble in a bag of blue. Be the person others will seek out to have a great experience skydiving on a whim, biking with no destination, or searching for a treasure not meant to be found.”</p>
<p>“But, what about everyday life?” one of our reported asked.</p>
<p>Sam grinned at this question, “The key to making everyday life extraordinary is to not care what anyone else thinks of you, and to hold your head high. Make sure to keep your feet on the ground, but the sky is the limit. You don’t need to follow society, make them follow you. You don’t need to seek out an extraordinary life; do things you love, and your life will naturally become just that.”</p>
<p>On our way out the door of our single floor ‘90s era suburban news station, we asked him one more question: “If you could give one piece of advice to someone who wants to be a child again, what would it be?”</p>
<p>He told us. He said that “the secret to being a child is that everyone is. The only way that you become an adult is when your mind tells you that the things you normally do to have fun are too ridiculous. Go live life. Don’t call yourself an adult, and don’t listen to anyone who tells you to grow up.”</p>
