    <p>“Hello my name is Sam Schooler, and I don’t know how old I am,” Sam admitted as he walked into <strong>Children’s Anonymous</strong>, a group which helps support adults who have not yet crossed the barrier from childhood to adulthood.</p>
<p>“I started going to this group a while back.” Sam told our reporter, “What I didn’t realize is that the group saw being a child as a flaw. I don’t see being a child as a flaw, I see it as an opportunity. An opportunity for me to do things adults my age would never think of doing.”</p>
<p>Sam went to the group only 3 or 4 times before he had enough, and “just kinda stopped going, and started watching clouds and stuff.” We were not satisfied. In this unique situation, we wanted to know more. We asked him about his experience once he accepted the fact he will be a child for the foreseeable future. “I think I will try to get more people to be children. That seems fun. A sort of group that supports older children.”<br>

    <p>Dear Someone,</p>
<p>Sometimes in life we go to special events, or travel to far off places where we meet people who are friendly people, but are not good for much else. We have never met them before, and probably will never again. They are awesome don’t get me wrong, but the fact that they live half way across the country is kind of a hindrance to any sort of on going connection.</p>
<p>This happens more often then we like. In a perfect world, everyone I meet who is worth giving the time of day, would be right down the block. Able to just grab a cup of coffee every once in a while, and keep a connection, but in our world, people live around the globe, and most everyone on it is worth looking at your watch for.</p>
<p>In our world, when you stop talking to someone, the relationship decays. You lose touch, and some relationships are not easy to keep up. Traveling from LA to New York enough to keep up a friendship; good friendship is HARD, not to mention Expensive. This is why our friendship won’t work out. But if we did live close, if it was easy to see each other in person every so often, we could be the best of friends.</p>
<p>And so I sit here writing a letter to my would be best friend, or someone who, if I lived close to, might just have saved my life one day. I am writing to them to say thank you for our would be friendship, and your would be ability to have a greater effect on my life. And for the short period of time I did actually get to converse with you. I would like to express my gratitude that, if we live closer together, we would probably go exploring together, maybe go on a road trip.</p>
<p>I am taking the time to write this, because I would just like to say that we may have been the greatest of friends, however, because of the randomness of the Universe, our paths do not stay together that long, they only cross for that moment in time, and probably will never cross again.</p>
<p>And for that brief moment in time, our life was a shared experience. For this, I would like to thank you. And respectfully, I would like to say farewell. Farewell to our possible shared life, and good luck with your future, where ever that may lead.</p>
<p>Forever Distant,</p>
<p>Sam Schooler</p>

    <p><em>UPDATED November 29th, 2014: Should work with LibGDX 1.X.X</em></p>
<p><a href="http://robovm.org">RoboVM</a> is an amazing free framework for writing iOS Applications in Java. I built an app with LibGDX, which ties into RoboVM last week. I don’t feel that it is worth charging for, so I wanted to make it ad-supported. In order to do this, I needed to implement a native library from MoPub, a ad mediation network. I had a couple kinks, but I successfully implemented AdMob/MoPub, in both iOS and Android, and I want to share how I did it.</p>
<p>If you are only putting ads in a iOS app, only follow the steps labeled [iOS], or if you are doing only an Android app, follow the [Android] tag. Obviously, if you are making an app for both platforms, do everything.</p>
<h2 id="Creating_Your_Project"><a href="#Creating_Your_Project" class="headerlink" title="Creating Your Project"></a>Creating Your Project</h2><p>Make sure before you start, to follow the LibGDK Wiki on how to <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-Setup-Gradle">Create a Project</a>. This will get you started with a LibGDX project. Then make sure to <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-and-Eclipse">Import your Project Into Eclipse</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Getting_Our_Resources"><a href="#Getting_Our_Resources" class="headerlink" title="Getting Our Resources"></a>Getting Our Resources</h2><p>Started out by downloading the [iOS] <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/robovm-ios-bindings/mopub-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar">RoboVM Bindings</a> and the [Android] <a href="https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/archive/master.zip">Full MoPub SDK</a>.</p>
<p>RoboVM bindings are basically “bridges” between the native iOS Objective-C and the sudo Objective-C Java RoboVM. This jar implements the Full MoPub iOS SDK, which allows us to get banners natively on iOS without writing a single line of Objective-C.</p>

<div class="article-body ">
  
    <p>“Learn from your mistakes” is a common saying heard throughout life. You probably first heard it from a parent, but chances are you also hear it from friends, coworkers, or teachers at least once a month. It is a great idea, make something that was a bad choice worthwhile, as if you are walking at night, and that mistake lights a part of the path, no matter how faint the light, it helps you stay on course.</p>
<p>However mistakes are not the only place one can learn from. It surprises me that mistakes are so often seen by society as the best way to learn, while successes do not seem to be highlighted as much. Success is the ultimate goal of any project, product, objective, or idea. Although “success” my be abstract, you know when you achieve it, and know how to succeed next time.</p>
<p>Being able to learn to not do something is great, but to learn how something is done is way better, and more efficient. For example when I try to memorize my name, I know the first letter is S, but if I only knew what the first letter was not, I would have to memorize a whole lot more. This idea of learning from success, not just from failure is not new, but it should be seen more equal, to learning from mistakes.</p>
