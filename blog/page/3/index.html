    <p><a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/" target="_blank" rel="external">GeekTool</a> is an awesome tool I use on my desktop everyday. It lets you make amazing interactive desktops from the weather to your CPU usage, a geek is at home. This tool is great, but when it comes to memory usage; it sucks. This is why I made a quick geeklet (an interactive piece for geektool).</p>
<p>It&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;me that no one has made something similar. What This does is it checks the memory usage of <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/" target="_blank" rel="external">GeekTool</a>, and if it is above a certain threshold, it restarts the app with a slight flicker, but nothing more noticeable.</p>

    <p>I am working on my java skills in a fun way, developing plugin for <a href="http://bukkit.org" target="_blank" rel="external">Bukkit</a>, a popular Minecraft server. I called the plugin <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/project-34294/" target="_blank" rel="external">qQuests</a>, and it adds, as the name suggests, quests to the game. This has become a great undertaking, and I’ve learned a lot from it, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to collaborate on software without actually talking to your partners in person</li>
<li>How to manage big projects</li>
<li>The headaches of not being able to immediately update code like on the web</li>
<li>How to update code like on the web</li>
<li>How to program in Java in general</li>
</ul>
<p>The second, how I can manage a project, was really aided with a project managing tool called <a href="https://trello.com/quaz3l/recommend" target="_blank" rel="external">Trello</a> (This is a recommend link, and not a referral link; I do not get any personal gain from it). Trello is so amazing and intuitive, it allows me to separate tasks into boards, and create a card for  each task, which can hold comment, tags, a description, and many other properties, but still stays simple. The boards are collaborative, and are dynamically updated. I use Trello because of the simple, and easy to use interface, which makes managing qQuests a breeze.</p>

    <p>You may or may not know, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU" target="_blank" rel="external">ITU</a> (an organization of the worlds countries connected to the UN) will be negotiating  <a href="http://www.itu.int/en/wcit-12/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">international telecom regulations</a>, and possibly end Net Neutrality, which means your service provider could charge you extra to visit “premium” sites like YouTube, and Facebook, etc. or slow down/stop any connection of their choosing. If you have not realized this is a HUGE issue! This would also allow your service provider to charge the website you are accessing to send you content, this would make prices of pay services like Netflix skyrocket, and force ad-based like Twitter, Facebook, and Google to either charge for their service, or plaster even more ads to your screen.</p>
<p>If you would like to keep your internet freedom, and prices down PLEASE send the ITU an email by signing up at <a href="http://www.internetcoup.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">internetcoup.org</a>. Thank you for supporting my freedom too!</p>

    <p>When I came across the <a href="http://john.onolan.org/ghost/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ghost</a> while reading HN I really liked it, and have thought about making something similar, but have never gotten around to it. In the last few days though I have put it together just as John described (I don’t know if its legal or morally right to publish it, but I will Blog about it at least because I have spent some time on it.</p>

<p>I finished working on the fifth image down in his post, -the post list and preview- I also finished the sixth image, which is the editor with markdown, and preview.</p>
<p>Now I am working on the backend which is created with PHP and the <a href="http://slimframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Slim PHP RESTful application framework</a>. If you would like to check out the current version of my rendering of Ghost, you can see it on GitHub <a href="http://quaz3l.github.com/ghost/g-admin/posts.html" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

    <p>It has been a week since I started using <a href="http://phonegap.org" target="_blank" rel="external">PhoneGap</a> to make my native app with open web standards, and I have run into some major trouble. I originally used Ajax to poll my server for updates every once in a while, but this approach does not work when the app is in the background, off, uses to much data to poll and get no updates, and there is to much latency. Then I moved on to <a href="http://socket.io" target="_blank" rel="external">socket.io</a>, which would solve the latency issue, and the data issue, but it will not run in the background, and <a href="http://appfog.com" target="_blank" rel="external">AppFog</a> does not have support for websockets currently.</p>
<p>I have now tried to fix this by making small native plugins for my app, so it can receive push notifications, and socket.io to receive websocket connections through javascript, when the app is in the foreground.</p>
<p>I hope this system works, if not I am going to have to redo it all again.</p>
