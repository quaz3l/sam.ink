    <p>You may or may not know, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU" target="_blank" rel="external">ITU</a> (an organization of the worlds countries connected to the UN) will be negotiating  <a href="http://www.itu.int/en/wcit-12/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">international telecom regulations</a>, and possibly end Net Neutrality, which means your service provider could charge you extra to visit “premium” sites like YouTube, and Facebook, etc. or slow down/stop any connection of their choosing. If you have not realized this is a HUGE issue! This would also allow your service provider to charge the website you are accessing to send you content, this would make prices of pay services like Netflix skyrocket, and force ad-based like Twitter, Facebook, and Google to either charge for their service, or plaster even more ads to your screen.</p>
<p>If you would like to keep your internet freedom, and prices down PLEASE send the ITU an email by signing up at <a href="http://www.internetcoup.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">internetcoup.org</a>. Thank you for supporting my freedom too!</p>

    <p>When I came across the <a href="http://john.onolan.org/ghost/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ghost</a> while reading HN I really liked it, and have thought about making something similar, but have never gotten around to it. In the last few days though I have put it together just as John described (I don’t know if its legal or morally right to publish it, but I will Blog about it at least because I have spent some time on it.</p>

<p>I finished working on the fifth image down in his post, -the post list and preview- I also finished the sixth image, which is the editor with markdown, and preview.</p>
<p>Now I am working on the backend which is created with PHP and the <a href="http://slimframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Slim PHP RESTful application framework</a>.

    <p>It has been a week since I started using <a href="http://phonegap.org" target="_blank" rel="external">PhoneGap</a> to make my native app with open web standards, and I have run into some major trouble. I originally used Ajax to poll my server for updates every once in a while, but this approach does not work when the app is in the background, off, uses to much data to poll and get no updates, and there is to much latency. Then I moved on to <a href="http://socket.io" target="_blank" rel="external">socket.io</a>, which would solve the latency issue, and the data issue, but it will not run in the background, and <a href="http://appfog.com" target="_blank" rel="external">AppFog</a> does not have support for websockets currently.</p>
<p>I have now tried to fix this by making small native plugins for my app, so it can receive push notifications, and socket.io to receive websocket connections through javascript, when the app is in the foreground.</p>
<p>I hope this system works, if not I am going to have to redo it all again.</p>

    <p>School has started for me, up here in Minnesota. That means I have almost no time to write or code. I did however rewrite Ideapress’s frontend to work better with <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone" target="_blank" rel="external">backbone.js</a>, which means now all the data is stored in models, in a neat collection.</p>
<p>Today, I also figured out that, since I am programming a native app with open web standards, I need to use something like PhoneGap, or <a href="http://trigger.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Trigger.io</a>. Unfortunately for me I have no budget since I am a high school student with no job (hire me?). Both are viable methods, but I went with trigger.io, because I loved the streamline terminal interface.</p>
<p>Using trigger.io’s forge tools is very easy in part because their servers do most of the work. I love using it, but today I went on their site to read the Docs, and was stunned that they came up with a viable business model (no web startups do these days…), a paid system. Since I am in high school with no credit card, much less a source of income, I can not pay a monthly fee. Thus I must say goodbye to trigger and move to PhoneGap. If someone affiliated with trigger reads this, do you mind making a student tier or something like that, with limited builds/updates per day/month, or premium plugins?</p>
