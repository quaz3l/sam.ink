<h2 id="The_Idea"><a href="#The_Idea" class="headerlink" title="The Idea"></a>The Idea</h2><p>I came up with a delivery service where I bake my own cookies from scratch, then deliver them on roller blades.</p>
<h2 id="The_Website"><a href="#The_Website" class="headerlink" title="The Website"></a>The Website</h2><p>For a delivery service, a website is essential. I created <a href="https://rollerbakers.com" target="_blank" rel="external">https://rollerbakers.com</a> as simple as possible, by quickly designing, and coding the frontend, keeping it as simple as possible. I also made a backend coded in Node.js which receives orders and forwards them to my email. This took me about 10 hours to finalize from Wednesday to Thursday.</p>
<h2 id="The_Startup"><a href="#The_Startup" class="headerlink" title="The Startup"></a>The Startup</h2><p>On Thursday, I went to Walgreens on Dartmouth and Broadway on my longboard and purchased a Square credit card reader for $10. I then created a Square account. Square reimburses you for buying a Square Reader, so I got my $10. I then went to Safeway and spend $8.60 on a few rolls of cookie dough. I wanted to end up making my own cookies from scratch, but I did not have enough money to purchase all the supplies in bulk. I spent the remaining $1.40 on printing a sheet of advertisements I spread around different floors of Towers.</p>
<h2 id="The_First_Order"><a href="#The_First_Order" class="headerlink" title="The First Order"></a>The First Order</h2><p>The first order came from a girl on 4th floor Towers North. She order 6 cookies. I grabbed 6 cookies, and my rollerblades (to keep up appearances) and delivered them. The girl who ordered the cookies and her friend were so surprised when I actually showed up. After talking for a bit about how my business works, I went on my way.</p>
<h2 id="Halloweekend"><a href="#Halloweekend" class="headerlink" title="Halloweekend"></a>Halloweekend</h2><p>With the profits from the first night ($8.50), I purchased bulk ingredients which, if I make a batch of 18 cookies a day, will last me a week and a half before I need butter and eggs, and chocolate chips. I then made a batch Friday night, and tried a different strategy: rollerblading around selling cookies on the street. That worked well. At the end of Friday I had sold 35 cookies, done 4 deliveries, and collected $34.65.</p>
